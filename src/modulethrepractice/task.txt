Task: Event Management System

You are tasked with designing a class for an Event Management System in Java.
The class should represent an event, such as a conference, concert, or sports game,
and should encapsulate various attributes and behaviors associated with events.

Your Event class should include the following attributes:

- Event Name: A string that represents the name or title of the event.
- Event Date: A date data type (you can use the java.util.Date class or the newer java.time.LocalDate class) to store the date of the event.
- Event Type: An enum type that represents the type of event. Define an enum called EventType with options like "Conference," "Concert," "Sports," etc.
- Ticket Price: A double data type that represents the cost of a ticket for the event.
- Location: A string that specifies the location or venue of the event.
- Capacity: An integer that indicates the maximum number of attendees the event can accommodate.

Your Event class should also include methods for the following behaviors:

- Calculate Revenue: A method that calculates the total revenue generated from the event based on the number of attendees and the ticket price.
- Check Availability: A method that checks whether there are available seats for the event.
  It should return true if there are seats available and false otherwise.
- ToString: Override the toString() method to provide a string representation of the event, including all its attributes.

Your task is to:

Design the Event class based on the given attributes and behaviors, ensuring proper encapsulation and data types.

Define the EventType enum with appropriate options.

Implement the methods mentioned above in the Event class.

Write a simple program to demonstrate the usage of the Event class.
Create instances of different events, calculate their revenue, check availability, and display event information.
